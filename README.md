p.s. I know a lot of the code is really messy and I apologize to those who bothered to read the code. I'm going to make an excuse and that excuse is that this was the first project in python that I had worked on since January and I made this in late July. As well as I had only just learned the basics of pygame from many youtube tutorials. Thanks for reading and again, I'm sorry for the messy code!
